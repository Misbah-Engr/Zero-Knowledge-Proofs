## Background
I have been sharing about this repo on x and I received an incredible feedback from https://x.com/gobbledy_ 

> maybe you could write these notes in more depth about what u learnt

So, from now on my notes will start getting in-depth.

## My plan today
I will finish the Rareskills ZK book chapter two, on which I was half-through.

Before that, I started with Succint, `crates/core/executor/src/disassembler/rrs.rs`

## What is RRS?
RISC-V Rust Simulator library: 

This is a collection of components designed to implement a **RISC-V instruction set simulation (ISS) in Rust**.

> RISC-V instruction set simulation (ISS) is a tool for developing software and evaluating architecture. It allows developers to cross-compile and execute code on their x86/x64 host PCs to ensure compatibility with the target architecture's specific instructions, such as DSP instructions or architectural-specific instructions that do not exist on a different host processor.

RRS supports the RV32IM instruction set, which includes basic instructions, arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operations, branching, load/store operations, and multiplication/division functionalities, but does not include OS/system level features like exceptions or memory management.

The library is modular and can be used by developers who need ISS components without requiring a monolithic ISS solution. It can be integrated into various projects, such as cycle-accurate performance models of CPU cores or co-simulations for validating CPU designs.

One other RISC-V simulator written in Rust is called riscv-harmony. It was developed by Brett Cannon. This simulator was inspired by the enjoyment of working with MIPS simulators during his undergraduate studies and the tradition of naming simulators after friendly vampires from the TV show "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".

there is a RISC-V processor emulator written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly called riscv-rust. This emulator can be imported into Rust or JavaScript projects and supports running Linux or xv6 in the browser.

## How is this relevant to the file?

The rrs.rs file I am reading is an important adapter between RRS (RISC-V Rust Simulator) and SP1's zero-knowledge virtual machine. It serves two main purposes:

#### 1: Instruction Translation

```
/// Transpile the [`Instruction`]s from the 32-bit encoded instructions.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function will return an error if the [`Instruction`] cannot be processed.
#[must_use]
pub(crate) fn transpile(instructions_u32: &[u32]) -> Vec<Instruction> {
    let mut instructions = Vec::new();
    let mut transpiler = InstructionTranspiler;
    for instruction_u32 in instructions_u32 {
        let instruction = process_instruction(&mut transpiler, *instruction_u32).unwrap();
        instructions.push(instruction);
    }
    instructions
}
```

#### 2: Format Normalization

instruction format normalization is a method where different instruction encodings are transformed into a unified representation to simplify processing. SP1's implementation converts RISC-V's variable-length instruction formats (R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, U-type, J-type) into a consistent 6-field structure (opcode, op_a, op_b, op_c, imm_b, imm_c), similar to how a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) might internally convert variable-length x86 instructions into micro-operations (Î¼ops). This normalization enables the zero-knowledge virtual machine to process instructions uniformly while maintaining semantic equivalence with the original RISC-V encoding, to create an intermediate representation (IR) that bridges the gap between the source ISA and the target proof system.
```
impl Instruction {
    /// Create a new [`Instruction`] from an R-type instruction.
    #[must_use]
    pub const fn from_r_type(opcode: Opcode, dec_insn: &RType) -> Self {
        Self::new(opcode, dec_insn.rd as u8, dec_insn.rs1 as u32, dec_insn.rs2 as u32, false, false)
    }

...
```
after normalization, SP1 converts ALL instructions into one consistent format:

```
Instruction {
    opcode: Opcode,     // What operation to perform
    op_a: u8,           // Usually the destination
    op_b: u32,          // First source/value
    op_c: u32,          // Second source/value
    imm_b: bool,        // Is op_b an immediate value?
    imm_c: bool         // Is op_c an immediate value?
}

```
## How it Integrates with RRS

- rrs.rs Uses RRS's instruction_formats module for parsing raw RISC-V instructions
- It Implements RRS's InstructionProcessor trait for instruction handling
- IT Supports RV32IM instruction set (Integer + Multiplication/Division)

## Importance of this file for Succinct

- It enables SP1 to leverage RRS's battle-tested RISC-V parsing
- It converts instructions into a format optimized for zero-knowledge proof generation
- It maintains compatibility with standard RISC-V toolchains while enabling zkVM capabilities

## Finally
I am sure this note is not up to the ideal standard but I am sure it is better than previous ones and they will get better with time. I will meet you in Note5 on the ZK book. Let me get back to my studies.
