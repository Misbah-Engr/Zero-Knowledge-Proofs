I am sorry I could not traverse back because:

- I have 53 more chapters to cover in the ZK book.

the tldr:
In the first chapter, the chapter 1 of module 1:
I learned P and NP problems and how to turn real life problems into Boolean circuits.
NP problems are problems which we can quickly prove if we are given the solution.
P problems are problems that we can deterministically solve in polynomial time.

P problems are easy to solve and easy to verify, while NP problems are easy to verify, but may not be always easy to solve.

Then, we have the third,

> Problems that require exponential resources to solve and verify are called problems in PSPACE. The reason they are called PSPACE is that although they might take exponential time to solve, they donâ€™t necessarily require exponential memory space to run the search.

Most researchers believe not all P = NP. that is N != NP.

Now, I am goind deep into chapter 2, where I started learning Arithmetic Circuits which are a more efficient way to represent real world problems for easy application to zero knowledge proofs. We dealt with some fun examples like 3 coloring of map for Australia.

See you soon
